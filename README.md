Forked fork of Samurai, originally written by yusuke in 2008.

Forked from a fork modified by SundeepB that added a CLI HTML output option.

This is primarily an educational project, allowing me to gain experience with the Eclipse IDE on MacOS, Windows (with some help from Win 10's Windows Subsytem for Linux) and Linux.

Goals include refining HTML output, fixing/refining tests, assuring build capability on MacOS, Windows and Linux. Additional goals include adding telemetry/monitoring to test theories and tool sets in that area.

Samurai is a visual thread dump analyzer, written in Java with Maven dependency management. It can be a very useful tool when examining thread dumps from Java apps encountering hangs or other unusual conditions.
